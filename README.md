# GLEAM-X-pipeline

The goal of this pipeline is to reduce the data observed as part of the GLEAM-X project (G0008), but it is also applicable to many other MWA datasets. The pipeline is written for the Pawsey Magnus and Zeus systems which use a SLURM job scheduler. It borrows significantly from the MWA-Fast-Transients pipeline written by Paul Hancock and Gemma Anderson: https://github.com/PaulHancock/MWA-fast-image-transients.

## Credits
Please credit Natasha Hurley-Walker, Paul Hancock, Gemma Anderson, John Morgan, Stefan Duchesne, and Tim Galvin, if you use this code, or incorporate it into your own workflow. Please acknowledge the use of this code by citing this repository, and until we have a publication accepted on this work, we request that we be added as co-authors on papers that rely on this code.

## Structure
Code directory (git clone here): /group/mwasci/$USER/GLEAM-X-pipeline
- bin: executable files and template scripts
- db: database location and python scripts for updating the database
- queue: location from which scripts are run
- queue/logs: log files
- models: Sky model files
Scratch directory (do processing here): /astro/mwasci/$USER/
- a project directory you name for yourself ($project in subsequent code)
- in each project directory, a set of obsids (usually $obsid in subsequent code)

## Scripts and templates
Templates for scripts are `bin/*.tmpl`, these are modified by the `bin/obs_*.sh` scripts and the completed script is then put in `queue/<obsid>_*.sh` and submitted to SLURM. Whichever cluster you are logged in to will be the one your jobs are submitted to. Time allocation "pawsey0272" is used on Magnus and project "mwasci" is used on Zeus.

## track_task.py
Used by the following scripts to track the submission/start/finish/fail of each of the jobs.
Not intended for use outside of these scripts.

## Example workflow

A typical workflow might look like:
   - Look on the MWA metadata pages for a set of observations of interest: http://ws.mwatelescope.org/admin/observation/observationsetting/ or http://ws.mwatelescope.org/metadata/find
   - Download the list of observation IDs to a text file
   - Go to /astro/mwasci/$USER/ and create a project directory with whatever pithy name you feel is appropriate
   - Put the text file there, and then run obs_manta.sh on it to download that list of observations
   - Once they have downloaded, for each observation, run obs_autocal.sh
   - Look at the calibraton solutions, and if they generally look OK, for each observation, run obs_apply_cal.sh to apply them
   - Run some deep imaging via obs_image.sh
   - Run the post-imaging processing via obs_postimage.sh to perform source-finding, ionospheric de-warping, and flux density scaling to GLEAM.

## Detailed script descriptions

### obs_manta.sh
Use the [ASVO-mwa](https://asvo.mwatelescope.org) service to do the cotter conversion and then download the resulting measurement set. No matter which cluster the jobs are submitted from, they will always run on the Zeus copyq.

usage:
```
obs_manta.sh [-p project] [-d dep] [-q queue] [-s timeave] [-k freqav] [-t] -o list_of_observations.txt
  -d dep      : job number for dependency (afterok)
  -q queue    : job queue, default=copyq
  -p project  : project, (must be specified, no default)
  -s timeav   : time averaging in sec. default = 4 s
  -k freqav   : freq averaging in KHz. default = 40 kHz
  -t          : test. Don't submit job, just make the batch file
                and then return the submission command
  -o obslist  : the list of obsids to process
```
uses templates:
- `manta.tmpl` (obsnum->OBSNUM/timeav->TRES/freqav->FRES)

### obs_autocal.sh
Generate calibration solutions for a given observation. Will use an A-team model in the anoko repository, or the GLEAM-based sky model in the GLEAM-X-pipeline/models directory, depending on the observation.

Usage:
```
obs_autocal.sh [-d dep] [-q queue] [-t] obsnum
  -p project : project, no default
  -d dep     : job number for dependency (afterok)
  -q queue   : job queue, default=workq
  -t         : test. Don't submit job, just make the batch file
               and then return the submission command
  obsnum     : the obsid to process
```

uses templates:
- `autocal.tmpl`
  - creates 3 time-step calibration solutions and compares them using aocal_diff.py to check the ionospheric variation (doesn't do a anything with that information at present)
  - creates a single time-step calibration solution like: `<obsnum>_<calmodel>_solutions_initial.bin`
  - plots the calibration solutions

### obs_apply_cal.sh
Apply a pre-existing calibration solution to a measurement set.

Usage:
```
obs_apply_cal.sh [-p project] [-d dep] [-q queue] [-c calid] [-t] [-n] obsnum
  -p project  : project, no default
  -d dep      : job number for dependency (afterok)
  -q queue    : job queue, default=gpuq
  -c calid    : obsid for calibrator.
                project/calid/calid_*_solutions.bin will be used
                to calibrate if it exists, otherwise job will fail.
  -t          : test. Don't submit job, just make the batch file
                and then return the submission command
  obsnum      : the obsid to process
```

uses templates:
- `apply_cal.tmpl` (obsnum->OBSNUM, cal->CALOBSID)
  - applies the calibration solution from one data set to another

### obs_self.sh
Self-calibrates a single observation -- not now typically performed as part of routine processing, but available.

Usage:
```
obs_self.sh [-p project] [-d dep] [-q queue] [-t] obsnum
  -p project : project, no default
  -d dep     : job number for dependency (afterok)
  -q queue   : job queue, default=workq
  -t         : test. Don't submit job, just make the batch file
               and then return the submission command
  obsnum     : the obsid to process
```
uses templates:
- `self.tmpl`

### obs_image.sh
Image a single observation.

Usage: 
```
obs_image.sh [-d dep] [-p project] [-q queue] [-t] obsnum
  -d dep     : job number for dependency (afterok)
  -q queue   : job queue, default=workq
  -p project : project, (must be specified, no default)
  -t         : test. Don't submit job, just make the batch file
               and then return the submission command
  obsnum     : the obsid to process
```
uses templates:
- `image.tmpl`
  - Make four channels and an MFS image
  - Stokes I
  - Joined-channel clean
  - Auto-mask 3-sigma; auto-threshold 1-sigma
